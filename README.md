# 📊 Shanghai Thomas Survey (STS)

**Shanghai Thomas Survey** is a year-long, project-based learning (PBL) program that introduces middle school students to the world of data science, research, and artificial intelligence. Through hands-on modules, students explore research design, data collection, analysis using Python, and the art of storytelling through data.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this PBL, students:

- Designed their own surveys based on meaningful research questions
- Collected and input data using Excel
